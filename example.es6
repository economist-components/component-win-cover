    women are to enjoy the same opportunities as men.

    The world's population was expected to reach seven billion in 2011. The
    increase from six to seven billion had only taken a dozen years, prompting
    a Malthusian panic about the dire impact of overpopulation. John Parker,
    then The Economist's globalisation correspondent, took a calmer view,
    arguing that the underlying rate of population growth was, in fact, slowing.

    The financial crisis of 2008 caught everyone by surprise—not least, it must

    his annual column of hits and misses to come clean about failing to spot the

    a new Bond novel (despite Fleming's death in 1964) and the latest Bond film.
    John Grimond, writer at large for The Economist and husband of Ian Fleming's
    niece, looked at what makes Bond such an enduring cultural character.

    In 2004 digital cameras outsold film cameras for the first time—but both
    were outstripped by sales of camera-phones, even though the quality of such
    cameras was hopelessly inferior. In The World in 2005, Tom Standage, then
