    The world's population was expected to reach seven billion in 2011. The
    increase from six to seven billion had only taken a dozen years, prompting
    a Malthusian panic about the dire impact of overpopulation. John Parker,
    then <i>The Economist</i>'s globalisation correspondent, took a calmer view,
    arguing that the underlying rate of population growth was, in fact, slowing.

    a new Bond novel (despite Fleming's death in 1964) and the latest Bond film.
    John Grimond, writer at large for <i>The Economist</i> and husband of Ian Fleming's
